;; Path types
;; ----------
;; abs-path : Absolute system path for the file.
;;            Example /home/lepisma/something.type
;; rel-path : Relative path of the file. Needs a project to get the root-dir.
;;            For example 2018/02/02/main.org
;; pile-path: Pile formatted path <project-name>:<rel-path>[::<internal-path>]
;;            For example wiki:emacs/til
